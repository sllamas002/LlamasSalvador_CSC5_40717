 * Purpose:6. Mass and Weight
Scientists measure an object s mass in kilograms and its weight in newton. If you
know the amount of mass that an object has, you can calculate its weight, in newton,
with the following formula:
Weight = mass Ã— 9.8
 Write a program that asks the user to enter an object s mass, and then calculates and
displays its weight. If the object weighs more than 1,000 newton, display a message
indicating that it is too heavy. If the object weighs less than 10 newton, display a
message indicating that the object is too light.
